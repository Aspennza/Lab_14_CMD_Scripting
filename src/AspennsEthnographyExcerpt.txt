While this description may make the show sound primarily like a fantastical superhero show, which, in part, it is, the bulk of the show is not so difficult to translate into real human experiences. 
At the core of the show and its conflict is the interpersonal relationship between Wanda and Vision and how this relationship evolves over time as circumstances change. 
Essentially, over the course of the TV series WandaVision, partners Wanda and Vision subtly negotiate how they will collectively interpret the world around them and how their relationship will operate within this context, and this leads their relationship to transform from high context to low context over time.
